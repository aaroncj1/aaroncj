## [Bitcoin Mining Information API][mining-api]

Java SpringBoot API I made to get up to date information on the current Bitcoin Mining profitability and current details about the Bitcoin Network

I plan to add more features in the future such as integrating with SlushPools API to get the status of my miners and latest stats about the pool luck.

## [Daily Passage][daily-devotional]

This is an older project I started awhile ago. It was built with Java Springboot and it retrieves bible passages from an ESV api based on a set devotional schedule. The response is in plain HTML so it will display ok on browser. Eventually would like to clean it up and improve on the code quality when I have time.

## [My Portfolio Site][portfolio-site]

This Site! I wanted to have a site to showcase my resume and the projects I have worked on. This was created using Jekyll Framework and it is hosted on an nginx server.
