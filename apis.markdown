## [Bitcoin Mining Information API][mining-api]

Java SpringBoot API I made to get up to date information on the current Bitcoin Mining profitability and current details about the Bitcoin Network

I plan to add more features in the future such as integrating with SlushPools API to get the status of my miners and latest stats about the pool luck.
